# 🌙 Todo App

A beautiful, minimal **Todo App** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
Inspired by a modern dark-themed style, this app helps you keep track of your tasks with a clean UI, progress bar, and task counter.

## ✨ Features

- **Add tasks** easily with the input and circular "+" button
- **Mark tasks as completed** (strike-through and color change)
- **Delete tasks** instantly
- **Progress bar** shows completion ratio
- **Modern, dark-themed UI** with card layout and glowing counter

## 🚀 How it works

1. **Add a new task:**  
   Type your task in the input and click the **"+"** button. Your task appears below.

2. **Complete a task:**  
   Click the checkmark (**✓**) on a task to mark it as done. The progress updates!

3. **Delete a task:**  
   Click the cross (**✕**) to remove a task.

4. **Progress tracking:**

5. **Persistent:**
